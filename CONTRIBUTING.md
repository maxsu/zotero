## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

In order to keep product discussions open to as many people as possible, Zotero does not use GitHub Issues for bug reports or feature requests. Please use the [Zotero Forums](https://forums.zotero.org) to report problems and suggest changes.

For confirmed bugs or agreed-upon changes, new issues will be created in the relevant repositories on GitHub by Zotero developers.
